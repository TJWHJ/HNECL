# HNECL(code will be released soon!)
This is the official PyTorch implementation for the paper:

Hongjie Wei, Junli Wang, Yu Ji, Chungang Yan, Mingjian Guang. Hierarchical Neighbor-Enhanced Graph Contrastive Learning for Recommendation. 2024.

## Overview
We propose a novel graph contrastive learning method called HNECL for recommendation, which aims to fully exploit the hierarchical neighbor relationships from both structural and semantic perspectives for better contrastive view construction.
